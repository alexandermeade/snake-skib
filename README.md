This was a silly little project â€” I just thought it'd be funny to make Snake in Skib lang.

## How to run and compile

To run and compile this, you'll need to:

1. Visit the [Skib Lang repository](https://github.com/alexandermeade/Skib-Lang).
2. Follow the instructions there on how to build and run Skib Lang.

then run the command below in the dir with your compiled skib code.
Note: it will look for main.lua as the compiled target for love so name your entry point file main so it compiles to main.
```
love <dir>
```

Enjoy!
